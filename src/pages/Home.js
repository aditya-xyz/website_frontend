              I am a software engineer, dog dad, coffee addict, photography
              enthusiast, and a fan of the outdoors â€” especially the Colorado
              mountains.

              I am a Microsoft Power Platform engineer by trade. The goal there
              is to use Microsoft Dataverse and its various connectors and
              services to come up with innovative yet low-code/no-code ways to
              stand up entire projects from the ground up quickly. These could
              be a web app, mobile app, a website, automations, etc. I have also
              done full stack ASP.Net development alongside Power Platform work.
              More recently, I am dabbling in the world of ReactJS and modern
              web architecture.

              Outside of work, I like to spend my time outdoors with my dog,
              Pixel. It's like being a van-lifer but only on the weekends and
              only using a car, but we make the most of it. My eventual goal is
              to road trip through all 50 states with her. So far, I'm on state
              #25, and Pixel is on #10. If you're interested in following her
              adventures, her Instagram link is in the footer!
